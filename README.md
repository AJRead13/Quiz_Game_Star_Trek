# Quiz_Game_Star_Trek
## Description
- The scope of this assignment was to build a random password generator using Javascript that satifies criteria that the user can specify.
- The result of this project demonstrates my grasp of how to leverage Javascript in order to create an interactive program that is easy to use and repeatable.
- Some of the issues that I ran into during this project were the use of proper syntax to not only call functions for their use, but to establish those functions in the first place.  But after a lot of time and research, I have managed to create a working final product.  
- This project has taught me a lot about Javascript's ability to handle certain points of "data", such as arrays, strings, numbers, booleans etc.  I made use of many of these features in my project.
